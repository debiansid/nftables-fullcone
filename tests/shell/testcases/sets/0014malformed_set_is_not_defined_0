# This tests for the bug corrected in commit 5afa5a164ff1c066af1ec56d875b91562882bd50.
# Sets were added to the table before checking for errors, and not removed from
# the table on error, leading to an uninitialized set in the table, causing a
# segfault for rules that tried to use it.
# In this case, nft should error out because the set doesn't exist instead of
# segfaulting
