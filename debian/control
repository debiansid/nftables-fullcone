Description: Program to control packet filtering rules by Netfilter project
 These are the user-space administration tools for the Linux
 kernel's netfilter and nftables. netfilter and nftables provide
 a framework for stateful and stateless packet filtering, network
 and port address translation, and other IP packet manipulation.
 The framework is the successor to iptables.
 .
 Netfilter and nftables are used in applications such as Internet
 connection sharing, firewalls, IP accounting, transparent proxying,
 advanced routing and traffic control.
 .
 A Linux kernel >= 3.13 is required. However, >= 4.2 is recommended.
