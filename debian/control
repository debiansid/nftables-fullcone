Description: Program to control packet filtering rules by Netfilter project
 This software provides an in-kernel packet classification framework that is
 based on a network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and the nft userspace
 command line tool. The nftables framework reuses the existing Netfilter
 subsystems such as the existing hook infrastructure, the connection tracking
 system, NAT, userspace queueing and logging subsystem.
 .
 nftables replaces the old popular iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables.
 .
 Netfilter software and nftables in particular are used in applications such
 as Internet connection sharing, firewalls, IP accounting, transparent
 proxying, advanced routing and traffic control.
 .
 A Linux kernel >= 3.13 is required. However, >= 4.14 is recommended.
